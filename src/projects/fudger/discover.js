            <p>In the earliest stage, we did preliminary research on food waste. 
                While food waste occurs at every stage (production, transportation, supplier, 
                consumer), we decided to tackle the consumer stage. The consumer stage was 
                broken down further into several steps, from which we decided that prevention 
                of excess food was the way to go. Therefore, we narrowed the problem 
                space to limit food waste within consumers by helping 
                them reduce over-purchasing during their grocery runs.

                Once we identified our goal, we conducted primary user research.

            <p> This included the field research, interview, and questionnaire. 
                Two members were designated for each method although the content 
                was prepared as a team.
